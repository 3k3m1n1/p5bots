## How Does This Work?
p5bots is a library that works to send messages from your browser, where you are running p5.js, to your microcontroller, most likely an Arduino. To do this, it uses the `socket.io` library and `node.js` to send messages between the two devices, in a language each device can understand.

This way, you can click on a sketch to light an LED or use temperature data to drive a sketch â€” or more.

p5bots comprises two sets of files: the client file, called `p5bots.js`, which is included in the `index.html` along with `p5.js` and your sketch; and the server files, called p5-server, which can be downloaded from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5bots-server).

If all this sounds crazy, you can also use p5bots from the [p5.js IDE](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor).

## p5.Serial
p5bots has a [serial method](doc/module-Serial.html) that can be used in combination with an Arduino sketch listening for serial, much in the same way the Processing serial library can.

For more details on this module, see [the p5.Serial reference page](doc/module-Serial.html).

If you use serial only, you do not need to install Firmata on your board.

## p5.Board
The majority of p5bots functionality lives within p5.Board. Inspired by [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), p5.Board provides a number of hardware-specific methods in addition to plain digital, analog, and pwm read/write methods.

Details for these methods, plus examples can be found in the module pages. Example sketches and hardware diagrams are also available in [the examples directory on the p5bots Github](https://github.com/sarahgp/p5bots/tree/master/examples).

## Getting Started
Ready to go? Good entry points include:
* [the Hello, World tutorial]()
* [checking out examples on the method pages, say RGB LED]()
* reading about [the client API](https://github.com/sarahgp/p5bots) and [p5-server](https://github.com/sarahgp/p5bots/tree/master/src/p5bots-server) on Github
* or, [heading over to p5.js to learn more about the drawing library]()
